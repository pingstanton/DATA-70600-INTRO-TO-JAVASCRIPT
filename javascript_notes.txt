ALERTS

alert("Hello, World!");

CONSOLE.LOG FUNCTION

console.log("Hello, World!");

OPERATORS (returns data type)

< ... less than (true/false)
> ... greater than (true/false)
<= ... less than or equal to (true/false)
>= ... greater than or equal to (true/false)
== ... equal to (true/false)
!= ... not equal to (true/false)
=== ... "strict" equal to (include type such as string, number, etc.)

Also...

% ... remainder (a number)
++ ... increment by one (a number)
-- ... decrement by one (a number)
- .. unary operator, the negative value of number (a number)
** ... exponentiation, base to exponent power (base^exponent) (a number)

+ ... add values if numbers (2 + 3 returns 5)
+ ... concatenate if strings ("my" + "string" returns "my string")

+= ... concatenate if strings (let mystring = "alpha"; mystring += "bet"; returns alphabet)

&& ... logical AND (expr1 && expr2)
|| ... logical OR (expr1 || expr 2)
! ... logical NOT (expr1 ! expr2)

a & b ... bitwise AND
a | b ... bitwise OR
a ^ b ... bitwise XOR

VARIABLES: This is NOT an operator...

= ... set value to a variable (aka "assignment operator")

var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = a + b;

var weather = 'sunny';
var statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';

RULES FOR VARIABLES
* must begin with a letter or an underscore
* cannot begin with a number (but can contain numbers after first character)
* cannot contain spaces or special characters
* case sensitive
* cannot use JavaScript reserved words
* Avoid hyphens (-), can cause error later if read as subtraction

NOTE: Later assignments recommend against var in favor of let and const

let = sets a global variable on root, or local variable within a function
const = sets a global variable that cannot be changed

REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. console.log() is best used for (select one):
* testing and debugging your code

3. Which of these variable names are legal (valid) in JavaScript? (select all that apply)
* my_books
* myBooks
* myBooks1

CHALLENGES

1. In JavaScript, as in algebra, ambiguity in a mathematical expression is resolved by rules of precedence (PEMDAS). For example, the expression 5 + 5 is evaluated as 10, while the expression 5 + 5 * 5 is evaluated as 30. Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression 5 + 5 * 10 /2 so that it resolves to 50. Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to true using the double equals == operator.

const result = (5 + 5) * 10 / 2;
console.log(result);
// returns 50

var a = 5 + 5;
var b = 10;
console.log(a == b);
// returns "true"


2. Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an alert to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. Note: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using console.log() to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.

alert("Open the developer console in your browser.");
console.log("You have won a prize.");

9/7: CHAPTER 3: IF/THEN
http://zweibel.net/Javascripting-Graduate-Student/workshop/javascript/?page=4

PROMPTS

var userName = prompt("What is your name?");

var whatAmI = prompt("What am I?", "I am a human!");
// ...in which "I am a human!" will show in the response field and act as the default return value if the user doesn't enter anything themselves

var userAge = prompt("How old are you?");
userAge = parseInt(userAge);
alert("You are " + userAge + " years old.");
typeof userAge;

IF/ELSE STATEMENTS
"If condition is met, then execute the task."

if (condition) {
	// code to run if condition is true
} else {
	// code to run if condition is false
}

Example...

    var userAge = prompt("How old are you?");
    userAge = parseInt(userAge);
    if (userAge >= 18) {
        alert("You are legally old enough to vote in the U.S.");
    } else {
        alert("You are not legally old enough to vote in the U.S.");
    }

ELSE IF STATEMENTS

if (condition1){
    // code to run if condition1 is true
    if (condition2){
        // code to run if condition2 is true
        if (condition3){
            // code to run if condition3 is true
        } else {
            // code to run if condition3 is false
        }
    } else {
        // code to run if condition2 is false
    }
} else {
    // code to run if condition1 is false
}

Example...

    var userAge = prompt("How old are you?");
    userAge = parseInt(userAge);

    if (userAge >= 18) {
        alert("You are legally old enough to vote and drive in the U.S.");
    } else if (userAge >= 16) {
        alert("You are not old enough to vote, but you are old enough to drive in the U.S.");
    } else {
        alert("You are not legally old enough to vote or drive in the U.S.");
    }

SWITCH STATEMENTS

    switch (variable) {
        case value1:
            // code to run if `variable` is `value1`
            break;
        case value2:
            // code to run if `variable` is `value2`
            break;
        case value3:
            // code to run if `variable` is `value3`
            break;
        default:
            // code to run if `variable` is not `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`
            break;
    }

Example...

    var difficulty = prompt("What difficulty would you like to play? 1- Easy, 2- Medium, 3- Hard");
    switch (difficulty) {
        case "1":
            alert("You have selected the Easy difficulty.");
            break;
        case "2":
            alert("You have selected the Medium difficulty.");
            break;
        case "3":
            alert("You have selected the Hard difficulty.");
            break;
        default:
            alert("Invalid entry.");
            break;
    }

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

var playerName, playerChoice;

    var playerName = prompt("What is your name?");
    alert("Welcome, " + playerName + "!");

    alert(playerName + ", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?");
    playerChoice = prompt("Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.");
    if (playerChoice == "1"){
        alert("Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.");
        playerChoice = prompt("Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.");
        if (playerChoice == "1"){
            alert("You swing the door open with courageous gusto.")
        }
        else if (playerChoice == "2"){
            alert("You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.")
        }
        else {
            alert("Invalid entry.");
        }
    } else if (playerChoice == "2"){
        alert("As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.");
        playerChoice = prompt("Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.");
        if (playerChoice == "1"){
            alert("Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.");
        }
        else if (playerChoice == "2"){
            alert("You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.");
        }
        else {
            alert("Invalid entry.");
        }
    }
    else {
        alert("Invalid entry.");
    }

REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. The prompt() function always returns a string.
* True

2. The code snippet below will throw errors or otherwise not work as intended. Why? Take a moment to look over it carefully, then select all that apply in the quiz below.

prompt("What is your name?");
if (name = "Sal Ami")
    alert("Hello name!");
else
    alert("It's too bad your name isn't" + name + ".");

* prompt() needs to be assigned to a variable.
* a double-equals (rather than a single equals) operator is needed in the if statement.
* the first alert will not correctly display name as intended.
* the if/else statement needs curly braces for each part.

3. Switch statements should have (select all that apply):

* break
* curly braces
* a default case

CHALLENGES

1. Write a program that has the user input a number. If the number is even, alert "The number is even." If the number is odd, alert "The number is odd."

var userInput = prompt("Enter a number:");
if (userInput % 2 === 0) {
    alert("The number is even.");
} else {
    alert("The number is odd.");
}

2. Utilizing switch statements, write a short Choose Your Own Adventure story that allows the player 3 choices to choose from at a time.

9/14: CHAPTER 4: LOOPS AND ARRAYS
http://zweibel.net/Javascripting-Graduate-Student/workshop/javascript/?page=5

ARRAYS

var myArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
var myArray3 = [true, false, true, false];
var myArray4 = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];

Accessing Values in an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
alert(myArray[0]); // returns 1

Changing Values in an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray[0] = 'cat';
alert(myArray[0]); // returns 'cat'

Adding Values to an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray.push('cat');
alert(myArray[5]); // returns 'cat'

Removing Values from an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray.pop();
alert(myArray[4]);

Splicing an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray.splice(0, 2);
alert(myArray[0]); // returns 'dog'

Determining the Length of an Array...

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
alert(myArray.length); // returns 5
alert(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // returns [1, 2, 3]

THE SORT() METHOD

By letter...

var myArray = ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd'];
myArray.sort();
alert(myArray); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

By number...

var myArray = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5];
myArray.sort();
alert(myArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

THE FOR LOOP

for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // do something
}

To break it down a little more...
* var i = 0: This is the starting point of the loop. It will serve as the index number of the first element in the array.
* i < array.length: This is the condition of the loop. It is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue. In other words, it says: "while i is less than the length of the array, do the following:".
* i++: This is the incrementor. ++ is a new operator that means that the value of i will increase or increment by 1 each time the loop executes. We use it to increment the index number of the loop so that it will continually move to the next element in the array.

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    alert(myArray[i]);
}

FOR LOOPS

var num = 5;

// looping from i = 1 to 5
// in each iteration, i is increased by 1
for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    console.log(i);     // printing the value of i
}

THE WHILE LOOP

var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    alert(i);
    i++;
}

Note: It is very important to make sure your while loops ultimately end by satisfying the condition you specify. If you don't, the loop will continue forever, and the user will be required to force-quit your program or close the window to stop it.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER - THE LIBRARY APP

var bookTitles = [
    'Too Loud a Solitude',
    'Things Fall Apart',
    'The Master and Margarita',
    'The Three Body Problem',
    'The Woman Destroyed',
    'Beloved',
    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',
    "Lady Chatterley's Lover",
];

bookTitles.sort();
var libRequests = [];
var requestedTitle = "";

alert("Welcome to the library!\n\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\n\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\n\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\n\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.");

var response = "";
while (response != 'quit') {
    response = prompt("Search for a book title or make a request by typing 'request': ");
    // check if the user wants to make a request
    if (response == 'request') {
        requestedTitle = prompt("What book would you like to request? ");
        libRequests.push(requestedTitle); // add the requested title to the library requests array
        alert("You have requested the following titles:" + libRequests + "."); // alert the user their requests
    }
    // check if the user wants to display all the titles
    else if (response == 'display') {
        for (var i = 0; i < bookTitles.length; i++) {
            alert(bookTitles[i]); // display all available book titles
            }
    }
    // otherwise, check if the book the user entered is in the library
    else {
        var bookIndex = bookTitles.indexOf(response);
        if (response != 'quit'){
            // if indexOf returns -1, the book the user entered is not in the library
            if (bookIndex == -1) {
                alert("Sorry, we don't have that book. You can always request it.");
            }
            else {
                alert("Yes, " + response + " is available to check out.");
            }
        }
    }
}


REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. What will be the result of the alert in the code below?

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray.pop();
alert(myArray[4]);

* undefined

2. What will be the result of the alert in this code snippet?

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
alert(myArray.length);

* 5

3. What will be the result of the alert here?

var myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];
myArray.splice(0, 2);
alert(myArray[0]);

* dog

CHALLENGES

1. Write a for loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 to the console.

var num = 100;
for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. The library program is very case sensitive, requiring the user to enter exact punctuation and capitalization of a book title. This is not a very robust search. Try improving the program using the toLowerCase method, which converts all the letters of a string to lowercase, to make the search parameters case insensitive. Hint: To match the two terms, you will want to perform the toLowerCase method both on the user's response as well as on each book title in the library. Try storing these results in new variables!

NOTE: toLowerCase METHOD

string.toLowerCase()

...as in:

const originalString = "Hello World";
const lowercaseString = originalString.toLowerCase();

console.log(lowercaseString); // Output: "hello world"

9/21: CHAPTER 5: FUNCTIONS
http://zweibel.net/Javascripting-Graduate-Student/workshop/javascript/?page=6

FUNCTIONS

function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    // code to be executed
    return value;
}

Notes:
* naming conventions for functions are lower CamelCase
* define the function's parameters or arguments within closed parentheses ()
* parameters are the values that will be passed into the function when it is called
* parameters are separated by commas
* functions return a value (in other words, a function takes some input, transforms that input somehow, and returns an output)

function add(num1, num2) {
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}
var result = add(1, 2);
alert(result);

// returns 3 in an alert

SCOPE - RETHINKING VARIABLE DECLARATIONS
var vs. let and const

var name = 'John';
let age = 30;
const isAdmin = true;

Notes:
* var declarations can be "globally" and "function/locally" scoped. 
* let declarations are block-scoped, only available within the block of code in which it is declared. 
* const is block-scoped but is immutable; once declared, const cannot be updated or re-declared.

THE STUDENT GRADES PROGRAM

Let's imagine that students have just submitted several homework assignments and we need to evaluate their grades. We want to:

1. Easily display their grades.
2. A new student has joined and submitted work, so we want to add a student to our list of students.
3. Evaluate their numbered grades to a letter (A, B, C, D, or F).

OBJECTS

Objects are collections of key-value pairs, and each key-value pair is called a property. The properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (objectName.propertyName) or bracket notation (objectName["propertyName"]).

Here we have a student object with three properties: name, grade, and GPA. To access the value of a property, we use the . syntax with the key. 

let student = {
    name: "Bob",
    grade: "A",
    GPA: 4.0
};

console.log(student.name); // logs "Bob"
console.log(student.grade); // logs "A"
console.log(student.GPA); // logs 4.0

ALSO: How to List the Properties of a JavaScript Object...
https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/javascript/how-to-list-the-properties-of-a-javascript-object.html

let object = {
  name: 'Jack',
  age: 25
};
let keys = Object.keys(object)
console.log(keys);

To retrieve the list of the property names, you can do the following:

let getKeys = function (obj) {
  let keysArr = [];
  for (var key in obj) {
    keysArr.push(key);
  }
  return keysArr;
}

Multiple objects in an array of objects...

let students = [
    {
        name: "Bob",
        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]
    },
    {
        name: "Alice",
        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]
    },
    {
        name: "Juan",
        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]
    }
];


Printing the Grades...

// print all student names and their grades
function printGrades(students) {
    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
        console.log(students[i].name + ": " + students[i].grades);
    }
}

printGrades(students);

Adding a Student...

function addStudent(name, grades) {
    let student = {
        name: name,
        grades: grades
    };
    students.push(student);
}

addStudent("Biff", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);

Converting Grades to Letters...

function convertGrades(students) {
    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
        let grades = students[i].grades;
        let letterGrade = "";
        for (let j = 0; j < grades.length; j++) {
            if (grades[j] >= 90) {
                letterGrade += "A ";
            } else if (grades[j] >= 80) {
                letterGrade += "B ";
            } else if (grades[j] >= 70) {
                letterGrade += "C ";
            } else if (grades[j] >= 60) {
                letterGrade += "D ";
            } else {
                letterGrade += "F ";
            }
        }
        console.log(students[i].name + ": " + letterGrade);
    }
}

convertGrades(students);

The whole program together...

let students = [
    {
        name: "Bob",
        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]

REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. What is the naming convention for functions in JavaScript?
* lower camelCase

2. What will be the result of the following code?

if (someValue > 0) {
    let greet = "hi there";
}

console.log(greet);

* ReferenceError: someValue is not defined

3. Should you use the var keyword to declare a variable?
* no

(REALLY THO? SOUNDS LIKE IT WORKS, BUT JS CODE FASHION NO LONGER PREFERS IT...)

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Before arrow...

hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}

With arrow...

hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

CHALLENGES

1. Write a function that always returns the last item in whatever array is passed to it. (Hint: Refer to the Loops and Arrays lesson if you need a refresher on an easy way to get the last element.)

function lastArrayItem(i) {
    return i[i.length - 1]; 
}

const thisArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const lastItem = lastArrayItem(thisArray);
console.log(lastItem);

2. Biff decided to drop your class after his unfortunate grades. Add a function to the Student Grades program that will remove Biff from the list of students using the pop method.

// assumes Biff ends up the first name in the array
students.sort();
students.pop(0);
printGrades(students);
convertGrades(students);

3. In the wild, you will often see what are called arrow functions. In modern JavaScript, arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions, and utilize the => (arrow) syntax. Check out this resource to learn about the syntax for arrow functions. Then, try to reformat the following traditional function using arrow function syntax instead:

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

let myFunction = (a, b) => a + b;

9/28: CHAPTER 6: MAKING MISTAKES
http://zweibel.net/Javascripting-Graduate-Student/workshop/javascript/?page=7

COMMON TYPES OF ERRORS

* Syntax Errors: When you fail to add or misspell an element of the language that is needed for the code to be understood.

* Type Errors: When you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong data type.

* Reference Errors: When trying to use a variable out of the scope in which it was declared.

* Logical Errors: When your syntax is actually correct but the code is not producing what you intended.

Writing Pseudo-code...

create function get password
    store correct password in variable
    prompt user for password
    while password is incorrect
        prompt for password
    alert user they may enter
    end function

General Tips...

1. Understand what your code is doing step by step.
2. Form a hypothesis or two before looking at the code.
3. Resolve syntax errors.
4. Identify key variables or conditions.
5. Think about your logic.

USING console.log() TO DEBUG

A quick and easy way to see the current state of a particular variable or condition.

REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. True or False - A syntax error occurs when code is not typed out correctly.
* True

2. True or False - A reference error occurs when a variable is used outside its scope or before it is declared.
* True

3. True or False - A logical error occurs when code works but is not producing the results you expected.
* True

CHALLENGES

1. Identify the logical error in the following code.

// find the even numbers in an array
let someValues = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < someValues.length; i++) {
    if (someValues[i] / 2 == 0) {
        console.log(someValues[i]);
    }
}

Answer: The function is checking if each value in the array divided by 2 is exactly equal to zero, for which the only correct match is 0 itself. Correcting the "/" operator to "%" to determine the remainder of each value not matching zero corrects the code.

// find the even numbers in an array
let someValues = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < someValues.length; i++) {
    if (someValues[i] % 2 == 0) {
        console.log(someValues[i]);
    }
}

2. Let's say you are writing a program that allows users to manage a collection of recipes. You want the user to be able to add, remove, edit, and search through their recipes. You also want the user to be able to "favorite" individual recipes and let them search and look through their list of favorites. Write some pseudo-code for a program that allows for each of these features.

Create an empty array to store the user's recipes.
Create an empty array to store the user's favorite recipes.

Create a function to add a new recipe to the user's recipes array.
Create a function to delete a new recipe to the user's recipes array.
Create a function to replace a new recipe to the user's recipes array.
Create a function to search and match query to the user's recipes array.
Create a function to list the user's recipes array.

Create a function to add a new recipe to the user's favorite recipes array.
Create a function to delete a new recipe to the user's favorite recipes array.
Create a function to replace a new recipe to the user's favorite recipes array.
Create a function to search and match query to the user's favorite recipes array.
Create a function to list the user's recipes array.
